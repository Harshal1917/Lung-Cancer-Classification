# Lung-Cancer-Classification
"""
 This project aims to develop an advanced deep-learning model for accurate and efficient lung cancer
 classification based on medical imaging data. The primary objective is to enable early and reliable
 detection of lung cancer, contributing to better patient outcomes and reducing the burden on
 healthcare systems associated with late-stage diagnoses.
